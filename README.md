# Stanford OpenSim RL NIPS2017

you know, to walk the skeleton. original DDPG code from github.com/ctmakro/gymnastics

# Dependencies

  - Python 3.5
  - TF
  - Canton
  - numpy, gym
  - osim-rl

# Note for users on Win7 x64 + Python 3.5 (2017-07-06)

Assume you want to run osim-rl on Windows w/py35, since TensorFlow support only Python 3.5 on Windows.

1. Build OpenSim yourself (since @kidzik didn't do this for us)

  - Install VC++ 2015 build tools. Should not take long
  - CMD
    - Clone the opensim conda builder, then run the build command:
      ```bash
      (chinese users) > set "HTTPS_PROXY=whatever_you_use"
      > git clone https://github.com/opensim-org/conda-opensim.git
      > cd conda-opensim
      > conda build opensim --python 3.5
      ```

      Above will fail on Chinese Windows due to file encoding error. If so, don't run `conda build` again, as that will create a new build environment and pull the whole OpenSim from GitHub again.

      Instead, open `D:\Anaconda3\conda-bld\opensim_1499279773305\work\dependencies\BTK\Utilities\Open3DMotion\src\Open3DMotion\MotionFile\Formats\MDF\FileFormatMDF.cpp` and replace every occurence of the square symbol (superscript "2") with "^2".

      The file should now look like:
      ```c
      //...
      { "Marker Acceleration", "m/s^2", "%.3fm/s2", "%.3f", (float)0.05},
      //...
      ```

    - Run the build script generated by the build process above again:
      ```bash
      > cd D:\Anaconda3\conda-bld\opensim_1499279773305(actual-path-may-vary)\work
      > bld.bat
      ```
      The compilation should run smoothly this time.

    - Since CMD was used to run `bld.bat`, you may notice that some commands, such as an `cp` (copy) did not run successfully. It should produce errors like that:

      ```bash
      (d:\Anaconda3\conda-bld\opensim_1499279773305\_b_env) Nonecp d:\Anaconda3\conda-bld\opensim_1499279773305\_b_env\Library
      \simbody\bin\simbody-visualizer.exe   d:\Anaconda3\conda-bld\opensim_1499279773305\_b_env\simbody-visualizer.exe
      'cp' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
      operable program or batch file.`
      ```

      you can do the copy manually, though.

    - also the `python setup.py install` might not run smoothly:

        ```bash
        (d:\Anaconda3\conda-bld\opensim_1499279773305\_b_env) Nonepython setup.py install
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "setup.py", line 8, in <module>
            execfile('opensim/version.py')
        NameError: name 'execfile' is not defined
        ```

        - cause

          `setup.py` is written in py2, so it seems that i built the py2(default) branch of OpenSim.

        - solution

          in `setup.py`, replace `execfile(name)` with `exec(open(name).read())`.

        Then `cd` to the correct path (`D:\Anaconda3\conda-bld\opensim_1499279773305\_b_env\Library\sdk\python`) and manually run `python setup.py install` or `pip install .`

    - Now test the OpenSim installation:
      - try `import opensim` in python.

        upon `import opensim` python may fail to find simbody's libraries.

      - solution

        add `D:\Anaconda3\conda-bld\opensim_1499279773305\work\opensim_build\Release` to your PATH.

2. install osim-rl

  - CMD

    ```bash
    (chinese users) > set HTTPS_PROXY=whatever_you_use
    > git clone https://github.com/stanfordnmbl/osim-rl.git
    > cd osim-rl
    > pip install .
    > cd tests
    > python test.manager.py
    ```

    You should see the skeleton swinging!
